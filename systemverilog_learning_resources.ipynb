    "### Chapter 1: Introduction to SystemVerilog\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is SystemVerilog?\n",
    "\n",
    "SystemVerilog is a unified hardware description and verification language that extends Verilog HDL with powerful new features for both design and verification. Standardized as IEEE 1800, SystemVerilog combines the familiar Verilog syntax with object-oriented programming, advanced data types, assertions, and sophisticated verification constructs.\n",
    "\n",
    "SystemVerilog serves dual purposes:\n",
    "- **Hardware Design**: Enhanced RTL modeling capabilities\n",
    "- **Verification**: Comprehensive testbench and verification features\n",

    "\n",
    "SystemVerilog follows C-like lexical conventions with some hardware-specific extensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case Sensitivity:**\n",
    "SystemVerilog is case-sensitive. `Signal`, `signal`, and `SIGNAL` are different identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identifiers:**\n",
    "- Must start with letter or underscore\n",
    "- Can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs\n",
    "- Keywords cannot be used as identifiers\n",

    "\n",
    "**Four-state Logic:**\n",
    "Traditional Verilog types that can represent 0, 1, X (unknown), Z (high-impedance):\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two-state Logic:**\n",
    "New SystemVerilog types that can only represent 0 and 1 (more efficient):\n",
    "\n",
    "```systemverilog\n",
    "// Two-state types\n",
    "bit    [7:0] two_state_bit;     // Only 0 or 1\n",
    "byte         two_state_byte;    // Only 0 or 1\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integer Types\n",
    "\n",
    "SystemVerilog provides several built-in integer types:\n",
    "\n",

    "int     counter = 1000000;\n",
    "longint timestamp = 64'h123456789ABCDEF0;\n",
    "\n",
    "// Arithmetic operations\n",
    "int a = 100, b = 25;\n",
    "int sum = a + b;        // 125\n",
    "int diff = a - b;       // 75\n",
    "int product = a * b;    // 2500\n",

    "// Real number types\n",
    "real      voltage = 3.3;\n",
    "realtime  delay = 10.5;\n",
    "shortreal frequency = 100.0e6;  // 100 MHz\n",

    "#### Arrays: Packed vs. Unpacked\n",
    "\n",
    "**Packed Arrays:**\n",
    "Elements are stored contiguously in memory, can be used in expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```systemverilog\n",
    "// Packed array declarations\n",
    "logic [7:0] byte_array;         // 8-bit packed array\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unpacked Arrays:**\n",
    "Elements are stored separately, used for memory modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "```systemverilog\n",
